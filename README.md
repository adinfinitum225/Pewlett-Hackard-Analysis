# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

This project is a basic analysis of employee data in a PostgreSQL database. Given the number of records involved, the data from our csv files was imported into Postgres in order to quickly and efficiently manipulate the data. Using SQL queries we selected the data we were interested in, and exported it to csv using the pgAdmin export tool.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to get information on the upcoming 'silver tsunami' at the company Pewlett-Hackard (PH). PH is a mature company and has been around for quite some time. Many employes are getting close to retirement age, and the leadership at PH needs information on those employees. Additionally, they need to get an overview of how many job positions and titles will be opening up so they can be prepared to fill those vacancies. The leadership at PH also brought up the idea of starting a mentorship program to help soon-to-be-retiring employees train the ones that will be taking their places.
